                <p>Hello Friends, Today I am going to share something special about me, which is my hobby. So my favorite hobby is Painting. I love Painting in my free-time. I also have Art classes in my school and I always look forward for it. It always keeps me happy, interested and busy. Whenever I am painting on a canvas or paper my table is messed up but after completing the painting I feel very happy. Painting is also very important and everyone should do it as it is relaxing and free of stress.
                    Thank you!
